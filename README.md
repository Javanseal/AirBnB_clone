The first stage is to design a strong storage system.
 This storage engine will provide an abstraction between objects  and How they are stored.
 This implies, the console code and from the front-end and Rest API will be built later, this ensures you wonâ€™t have to pay attention of how your objects are stored.

What the console will do:

  1. create a new object
   2. Retrive an object from a file
   3. Do operations on objects
   4. Destroy an object.

Example how to open:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
